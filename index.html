    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Hack 'n' Tell is a nine hour event in which a bunch of people sit in the
      same room, eat delicious food, and make something. There is no need
      for business models, customer validation, or extravagant pitches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The purpose of this hackathon</strong> is to hang out and team up with other developers
      and designers for the sake of making something. There will be time at the
      end of the event where you are free to show and tell everyone about
      the awesome thing that you built.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can build something for yourself, build something for other people,
      or help someone else build something. You can build something useful or
      build something that is completely useless: the choice is all yours.
      All we want is to spend time with other people who want to <em>create</em>.

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
    <h4>Can I come if I donâ€™t have an idea?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes, just imagine you have 8 uninterrupted hours to work on ANYTHING you've been tinkering with/dreaming of, and then show it off to ~75 excited people. 
    </p>
    <h4>Wait... does RokkinCat/Sponsors own my idea after this???</h4>
    <p>
      <em>No.</em> Creators retain 100% of their products/idea. 
    </p>
    <h4>What are the requirements?</h4>
    <p>
      Know how to code and or design enough to 'hack' on something you think is cool. And show it off. Or don't, your call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't know any of the above and want to spend the time learning, and showing what you've learned? That's great too!
    </p>
    <h4>Can I come if I am a student, or if I am not in the industry?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes. See above.
    </p>
    <h4>What's it all about?</h4>
    <p>
      Hacking on stuff you think is cool. And showing it off.
    </p>
    <h4>Will there be prizes?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes, but it's not about the prize. It's about making stuff and having fun. 
    </p>

    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>
      Because a business plan shouldn't win a hackathon. 
    </p>

    <h4>Will there be food?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes, we will provide breakfast and lunch options. 
      <em>MENU PENDING (probably chipotle burritos and panera)</em>.
      If you have dietary restrictions please let us know and we will try our best.
